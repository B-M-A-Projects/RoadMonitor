# RoadMonitor (version 1.0)

## Description

This is a fork of Greg Tinker's car speed detector. The motion detection part has been re-designed and functionality has been added to store speed and statistics in an influx database that can be displayed with Grafana. Functionality has also been added to identify faulty measurements and to exclude them.
